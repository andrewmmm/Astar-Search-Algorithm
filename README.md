# Astar-Search-Algorithm
An implementation of a homework project using the A* search algorithm to find a path on a grid


This is a javascript application (using react) that uses the A* algorithm (an extension from Dijkstra's search algorithm) to find the shortest path from A to B. Time complexity is b^d.
